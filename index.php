      <div align="center"><p><h4>CLASS ACTION & MASS TORTS</h4></p></div>
      <div align="center"><p><h5>Mass torts often involve injuries to a distinct group of individuals who may reside in the same geographic area. The number of people injured in mass tort cases are sometimes smaller than those injured in larger class actions.</div></h5></p>

      <div align="center"><p><h4>WRONGFUL DEATH</h4></p></div>
      <div align="center"><p><h5>If a person is killed because of the wrongful conduct of a person or persons, the decedent's heirs and other beneficiaries may file a wrongful death action against those responsible for the decedent's death. This area of Tort Law is governed by statute. Wrongful death statutes vary from state to state, but in general they define who may sue for wrongful death and what, if any, limits may be applied to an award of damages.</div></h5></p>

      <div align="center"><p><h4>PRODUCT LIABLITY</h4></p></div>
      <div align="center"><p><h5>Product liability refers to a manufacturer or seller being held liable for placing a defective product into the hands of a consumer. Responsibility for a product defect that causes injury lies with all sellers of the product who are in the distribution chain. In general terms, the law requires that a product meet the ordinary expectations of the consumer. When a product has an unexpected defect or danger, the product cannot be said to meet the ordinary expectations of the consumer.</div></h5></p>

      <div align="center"><p><h4>EMPLOYMENT LAW</h4></p></div>
      <div align="center"><p><h5>Labour law (also known as labor law or employment law) mediates the relationship between workers, employing entities, trade unions and the government. Collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between employee, employer and union. Individual labour law concerns employees' rights at work and through the contract for work. Employment standards are social norms (in some cases also technical standards) for the minimum socially acceptable conditions under which employees or contractors are allowed to work. Government agencies (such as the former US Employment Standards Administration) enforce labour law (legislative, regulatory, or judicial).</div></h5></p>

      <div align="center"><p><h5>Being in the presence of some substance in an environment. Typically, that substance is pollution or a hazardous waste. Low-level, repeated exposure to hazardous substances is a documented risk. It can lead to serious health problems. Location is typically a work environment, where exposure normally does not exceed threshold levels.</div></h5></p>

      <div align="center"><p><h4>PREMISE LIABLITY</h4></p></div>
      <div align="center"><p><h5>The plaintiff must be an invitee or, in certain cases, a licensee.[1] Traditionally, trespassers were not protected under premises liability law.[1] However, in 1968, the California Supreme Court issued a vastly influential opinion, Rowland v. Christian, 69 Cal.2d 108 (1968), which abolished the significance of legal distinctions such as invitee, licensee, or trespasser in determining whether one could hold the possessor of a premises liable for harm. This opinion led to changes in the law in many other states in the United States, and is viewed as a seminal opinion in the development of the law of premises liability.</div></h5></p>
